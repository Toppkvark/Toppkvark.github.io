    <h2>Accomplished during the sprint</h2>

      Implemented interactive floorplan, data handling and functionality. We
      were able to have a meeting with a KTH staff member about the API we
      intended to use. We implemented a lot of functionality to the website and
      most of the UI/UX is finished.<br />
