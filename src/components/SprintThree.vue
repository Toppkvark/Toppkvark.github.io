    <h2>Accomplished during the sprint</h2>
    <p>
      During this sprint we continued implementing MVC architecture.
      We were unfortunately not able to get a hold of the TimeEdit API 
      and so weâ€™ve resorted to building our own database, starting with a 
      simple .json and implementing functionality. <br />
